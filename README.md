# CFG Web Development Course Project
The final project I created whilst undertaking the Introduction to Web Development course run by Code First Girls. It is a business [website]( https://robynfsj.github.io/cfg-web-dev-project/) for a holiday park and was built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Although we were briefly introduced to JavaScript in one session of the course, I felt I didn't have time to learn it properly so decided to focus on mastering HTML and CSS for my final project.
